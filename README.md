Oi, Grandad 2! is an updated version of the original "classic". New features include:

 **4 Voices in one**

Each voice now has 4 playheads with control of the position, pitch and so on. Instead of adjusting each head individually, changes are made in groups with a (HOPEFULLY) musically pleasing algorithm controls their movement.

 **Modulation presets**
 
You can now chose between 1 of 8 presets. In true Oi, Grandad! spirt you can also modulate between presets.

 **Mixer**

A dedicated mixer panel with a simple EQ, compressor, simple reverb and a multistage delay/filter.

 **Resonator**
 
Each of the four voices new has a wave guide resonator at the end of the signal chain. These can be used to create a variety of plucked and bowed string effects, short delays and other weirdness. The resonators pitch track to midi input over a limited range and can also be internally modulated. Other controls include a mix parameter, feedback and 1 pole low pass filter. Please note the resonator can significantly increase the gain of the voice with higher feedback settings, so watch your levels!
